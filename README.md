# VehicleCrudApplication
 
###### Instructions to run

The backend requires a mysql server that can be hosted using your computer.

The configuration settings to set up access to your mysql backend can be found in the application.properties file.
This allows the data to be permananent while connected to the mysql backend.

The backend should be compiled as a spring app to ensure functionality.
Personally I ran it using Eclipse's spring app plugin that allows it to run as a spring web server 

The frontend is found in a folder named VehicleCrudFrontend/react-frontend, navigate down to that folder then enter npm install then npm start in the terminal to run the frontend of the app.
